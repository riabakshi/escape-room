# escape-room
An escape room game created using Python Graphics during my first programming class in sophomore year of high school (2023).

## Run this project!
Run the main.py script and let the game begin.

## How to play
The user must first enter the house, then click on various objects within the house which require 
users to call upon their knowledge of various types of ciphers to get clues to the phrase used to escape the escape room.
When they think they have all the clues they need, they can enter the passkey to escape by clicking on the lock objects.
